# Deploying a Web App on Render

This guide will walk you through deploying a web application on [Render](https://render.com).

## Steps to Deploy:

### 1. Create a GitHub Repository
1. Log in to your GitHub account.
2. Create a new repository by clicking the **New** button.
3. Name your repository (e.g., `dash-render-app`) and initialize it with a README if desired.


### 2. Push Your Code to the Repository
Follow these steps to push your local project to the GitHub repository:

```bash
# Create a README file
echo "# dash-render-app" >> README.md

# Initialize a Git repository
git init

# Add README to the staging area
git add README.md

# Commit the changes
git commit -m "first commit"

# Set the main branch as default
git branch -M main

# Add the remote repository (replace with your GitHub repository's URL)
git remote add origin git@github.com:user/repo-name.git

# Push the changes to the remote repository
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Connect the GitHub Repository to Render
1. Log in to your Render account at [https://render.com](https://render.com).
2. Navigate to the **Dashboard** and click **New +**.
3. Select **Web Service**.
4. In the repository list, connect your GitHub account and select your repository.

### 4. Create a Web App on Render
1. After connecting the repository, configure your web app:
   - Give your app a name.
   - Choose a region for deployment (e.g., North America, Europe).
2. Click **Create Web Service** to proceed.

### 5. Configure Deployment Settings
1. **Environment**: Choose your app environment (e.g., Python, Node.js, etc.).
2. **Build Command**: Specify the command to build your app (e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt` for Python).
3. **Start Command**: Add the command to run your app (e.g., `python app.py` for a Flask/Dash app).
4. Review and save your configuration.


Your web app will now deploy automatically. Render will build, deploy, and make it available at a public URL.

### Notes
- Ensure that your repository includes all required dependencies and a `requirements.txt` or equivalent file.
- You can monitor logs and redeploy from the Render dashboard.
- Use numpy==2.1.0 if required for python 3.10.
